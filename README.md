# Genetic-Vehicle-Routing-Problem


This program uses a genetic algorithm to solve the vehicle routing problem. The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is similar to the Travelling salesman (TSP) problem. The difference between the two is that the VRP problem has to optimize n paths, not just one. So solving the VRP for n = 1 is equivalent to the TSP.

There are only three files here, the points located around Berlin, the notebook that contains the visualizations and code, and this file that you're reading right now. I got data for Berlin from here: http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/
